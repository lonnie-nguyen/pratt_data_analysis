# Amino Acid Conservation Visualization

This github repo contains the archived results of a Colab notebook which analyzes and provides visualization for Pratt data. The notebook was developed for Professor Charles Glabe at UCI.

The most current iteration of the notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lonnie-nguyen/pratt_data_analysis/blob/main/pratt_seq_logo_unaligned_seq.ipynb) along with a how-to manual.
